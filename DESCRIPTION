Description: Provides access to the 
    Idea Data Center (IDC) application for conducting 
    nonresponse bias analysis (NRBA). The IDC NRBA app is an
    interactive, browser-based Shiny application that can be used to 
    analyze survey data with respect to response rates,
    representativeness, and nonresponse bias. This app provides a user-friendly
    interface to statistical methods implemented by the 'nrba' package.
