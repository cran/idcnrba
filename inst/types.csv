1,Calculate response rates by subgroup,"This analysis assesses whether different subgroups are more or less likely to respond to the survey, by comparing their response rates. <br><br> In the fields below, select one more grouping variable(s) to calculate response rates for different subgroups, the response rate formula to be used, and the method for classifying nonrespondents with unknown eligibility. To calculate an overall response rate for your survey, leave the grouping variable field empty."
2,Test whether subgroups differ in likelihood of responding,"This analysis uses a Chi-squared test to assess whether observed differences in response rates across subgroups are simply due to randomness rather than to systematic differences between subgroups in their likelihood of responding to the survey.<br><br>In the field below, select the grouping variable(s) for which you would like to conduct a Chi-squared test."
3,Identify variables that predict likelihood of responding,"This analysis uses variables in a logistic regression model to predict whether an individual is a respondent rather than a nonrespondent. If a grouping variable in your dataset effectively predicts response to the survey, this implies that some subgroups are underrepresented among respondents and there is risk of nonresponse bias.<br><br>In the fields below, select the grouping variables to use as predictors in the regression model."
4,Compare subgroup percentages in respondent data to data from respondents and nonrespondents,"This analysis uses a Chi-squared test or t-test to assess whether observed differences between subgroup percentages among respondents (estimates) and subgroup percentages in the full sample are indicative of some subgroups in the population being overrepresented or underrepresented in the survey.<br><br>In the fields below, select the parameters of the test you would like to use."
5,Compare subgroup percentages in respondent data to external data,"This analysis uses a Chi-squared test or t-test to assess whether observed differences between respondent subgroup percentages (estimates) and subgroup percentages in external data (benchmarks) are indicative of some subgroups in the population being overrepresented or underrepresented in the survey.<br><br>In the fields below, select the parameters of the test you would like to use."
6,Compare outcomes across subgroups,"This analysis type compares outcomes across subgroups by calculating percentages for each category of an outcome variable, separately for each subgroup. The application uses a Chi-squared test to assess whether observed differences among subgroups in outcome percentages are simply due to randomness rather than actual population differences. Nonresponse bias will occur if subgroups systematically differ in likelihood of responding to the survey, and they also differ in outcomes the survey measures."
7,Identify variables that are predictive of survey outcomes,"This analysis uses variables in a regression model to assess which grouping variables are predictive of survey outcomes. If a grouping variable in your dataset effectively predicts response to the survey and effectively predicts survey outcomes, there is risk of nonresponse bias with respect to that variable.<br><br>In the fields below, select the parameters of the test you would like to use."
8,Assess how outcomes change as level-of-effort increases,"This analysis evaluates how survey estimates change as you expend additional effort to obtain survey responses, such as by making additional contact attempts or increasing incentives. This analysis assumes that respondents who are harder to reach are more similar to nonrespondents than to respondents who are easier to reach. If the estimates differ between hard-to-reach respondents and easy-to-reach respondents, this could suggest potential nonresponse bias.<br><br>In the fields below, select the variables to use for this analysis."
9,"Compare estimates based on respondent data, before and after weighting adjustments","You can use weighting adjustments to correct for imbalances between your respondent data and the target population. This analysis uses raking weighting adjustments to increase the influence of respondents from underrepresented subgroups so that these subgroups' influence on estimates is proportional to their share of the target population. Statistically significant differences between adjusted and unadjusted estimates reflect the potential for nonresponse bias.<br><br>In the fields below, select the required parameters to implement weighting adjustments."
