input_file,"Select a file (in CSV, Excel, SAS, or SPSS format) containing data to use for analysis. See ""Getting Ready to Use the NRBA App: Preparing Your Dataset"" for requirements and recommendations."
output_files_df,"Select a file (in CSV, Excel, SAS, or SPSS format) containing data to use for analysis. See ""Getting Ready to Use the NRBA App: Preparing Your Dataset"" for requirements and recommendations."
data_collection_method,"Indicate whether the survey data come from an attempted census or a random sample. In an attempted census, you seek responses from every member of the target population. While every individual might not actually respond, the key feature of an attempted census is that you sought responses from 100% of the population. In contrast, in a survey sample, you seek responses only from a subset of the population and select that subset using random sampling."
response_eligibility_variable,"This variable classifies each person in the data based on if the person responded to the survey and was elgible to do so.  This variable should have at most four distinct values that reflect eligible respondent, eligible nonrespondent, ineligible, or unknown eligibility."
eligible_respondents,Select the value of the response/eligibility status variable in your dataset which represents eligible respondents. Eligible respondents are individuals who were eligible to complete the survey and did so.
eligible_nonrespondents,"If applicable, select the value of the response/eligibility status variable in your dataset which represents eligible nonrespondents. Eligible nonrespondents are individuals who were eligible to complete the survey but did not do so. If you do not have eligible nonrespondents, select DOES NOT APPLY."
known_ineligible,"If applicable, select the value of the response/eligibility status variable in your dataset which represents cases you know to be ineligible for the survey. For example, if you invited a person to complete a school parent survey, and that person replied that they are not a parent, classify that person as ineligible. If you do not have ineligible cases, select DOES NOT APPLY."
unknown_ineligible,"If applicable, select the value of the response/eligibility status variable in your dataset which represents cases whose eligibility status you do not know. For example, suppose you mail a survey intended only for parents of school-aged children to a random sample of addresses in a school district. If a given address never replies to the survey, and you do not know whether any parents live at that address, then classify the case as having unknown eligibility. If you do not have unkown eligibility cases, select DOES NOT APPLY."
group_nonrespondents,"If most cases with unknown eligibility are likely to be eligible for the survey, then it is useful to treat unknown eligibility cases as eligible nonrespondents for most analysis types. However, when calculating response rates, it is still helpful to distinguish between eligible nonrespondents and unknown eligibility cases."
sampling_weight_variable,"If the sampling method caused some members of the population to have a larger chance of being sampled compared to other members of the population, you will need a variable that gives each person a sampling weight. The sampling weight for a given sampled person is calculated as 1 divided by that person's probability of being selected into the sample. The sampling weight variable should not have any missing or negative values. Select No Weights when each person is assumed to have had an equal probability of being sampled."
strata_variables,"Stratification involves dividing the population into subgroups with predetermined sample sizes. If stratified sampling was used for your survey, select the variable which divides the population into strata. If there are multiple stages of stratified sampling, then select one stratification variable for each stage of sampling. For example, a state may select a random sample of school districts within each geographic region of the state, and then select a random sample of students within each of the sampled school districts. In this example, region and district are the strata used for sampling. "
cluster_label,"Cluster sampling involves using random sampling to select a group (i.e., cluster) of individuals instead of directly sampling the individuals themselves. Cluster sampling may occur in multiple stages, such as when a random sample of school districts is selected and then a random sample of schools is selected from each of the sampled districts. If cluster sampling was used for your survey, select the first-stage cluster variable (e.g., school district) and, if applicable, the second-stage cluster variable (e.g., school)."
population_size_variables,"If a census was attempted or if a large fraction of the population (>20%) was randomly selected for the survey, you can account for the large sampling fraction by selecting a variable in your data which gives the population size. If stratified sampling was used, this variable should contain the population size for each stratum. If cluster sampling was used, the population size should be the number of clusters in the population rather than the number of individuals. If multistage cluster sampling was used, select one population size variable for each stage of sampling."
psu_cluster_variables,"Cluster sampling may occur in multiple stages, such as when a random sample of school districts is selected and then a random sample of schools is selected from each of the sampled districts. If cluster sampling was used for your survey, select the first-stage cluster variable (e.g., school district)."
ssu_cluster_variables,"Cluster sampling may occur in multiple stages, such as when a random sample of school districts is selected and then a random sample of schools is selected from each of the sampled districts. If multistage cluster sampling was used for your survey, select the second-stage cluster variable (e.g., school)."
replicate_weights,Select this option if the input dataset contains replicate weights to use for variance estimation.
combined_weights,"Columns of replicate weights are usually a combination of replicate factors and sampling weights, but sometimes the columns of replicate weights are only based on replicate factors and not the sampling weights. Select this option if the replicate weights already include sampling weights."
replicate_weight_variables,Select the columns of replicate weights in the data.
replicate_weight_method,Select the method used to create the replicate weights.
rho,"If the replication method is Fay or BRR, you can specify a value for Fay's coefficient (also known as the Rho shrinkage factor)."
scales,Select an overall scale factor for variance estimation using the replicate weights.
rscales,Enter replicate-specific scale factors for variance estimation (one value per column of replicate weights).
analysis_response_rates_group,"Select one or more variables in your dataset which divide the sample into different subpopulations (e.g., race/ethnicity), and whose values you know for both respondents and nonrespondents. Grouping variables can be either numeric (e.g., age in years) or categorical (e.g., disability category). The application will calculate response rates for each combination of values of the grouping variables. If you do not select grouping variables, the application will calculate a single, overall response rate."
rr_formula,"The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) identifies several standard formulas for calculating response rates. The formulas differ in how they handle cases whose eligibility status is unknown. The application recommends RR3 for most purposes, which uses an estimate of the eligibility rate among cases with unknown eligibility. Alternatively, you can choose for the application to use RR1, which assumes that all cases with unknown eligibility are eligible, or RR5, which assumes that all cases with unknown eligibility are ineligible."
elig_method,"If you use RR3, the application uses a method to estimate the percent of cases with unknown eligibility who are eligible for the survey. The CASRO method uses the eligibility rate among cases with known eligibility status. The CASRO subgroup method is recommended, in which the application calculates estimates separately for each subgroup. If you select CASRO overall, the application calculates an estimate for the overall sample and uses this single estimate when calculating response rates for subgroups.  Alternatively, you can specify an estimate for the application to use."
e_specified,"If you use RR3 and set the method for estimating the eligibility rate to Specified, you may enter a number between 0 and 1 to use as the estimated eligibility rate for cases with unknown eligibility status."
chisq_aux_variables,"Select one or more variables in the data which divide the sample into different subpopulations (e.g., race/ethnicity), and whose values you know for both respondents and nonrespondents. Grouping variables can be either numeric (e.g., age in years) or categorical (e.g., disability category). For each grouping variable, the application will conduct a Chi-Square test to assess whether the subgroups that variable defines have different likelihoods of responding to the survey."
t6_numeric_predictors,Select one or more numeric grouping variables in your dataset to use as predictors in the regression model.
t6_categorical_predictors,Select one or more categorical grouping variables in your dataset to use as predictors in the regression model.
t6_model_selection,"Choose a method for determining which grouping variables to include in the regression model. You can include all of the variables listed above in the model, or you can use a stepwise model selection method to potentially reduce this list to a subset of the variables."
t6_alpha_enter,"If you use the stepwise model selection, then the application will add and remove variables to the model in an iterative process based on p-values. Enter the maximum p-value that a predictor variable can have in order to enter the model at a given iteration of the stepwise model selection algorithm."
t6_alpha_remain,"If you use the stepwise model selection, then the application will add and remove variables to the model in an iterative process based on p-values. Enter the maximum p-value a predictor variable can have in order to remain in the model at a given iteration of the stepwise model selection algorithm."
t6_max_iterations,"If you use the stepwise model selection, then the application will add and remove variables to the model in an iterative process based on p-values. Enter the maximum number of iterations of the procedure."
t3_y_var,"Select a variable in your dataset which divides the sample into different subpopulations (e.g., race/ethnicity), and for which you only have values for respondents. This variable can be either numeric (e.g., age in years) or categorical (e.g., disability category)."
t3_y_var_categorical,Indicate if the variable is categorical or not.
t3_t_or_chisq_test,"Choose whether to compare categorical variables using t-test or Chi-squared test. T-tests provide tests of differences for specific categories, while a Chi-Squared test provides a single overall test of whether any of the survey estimates significantly differ from benchmarks."
external_benchmark_value,"Enter benchmark data for the selected dependent variable. For numeric variables (e.g., age in years), enter the mean. For categorical variables (e.g., disability category), enter a percentage for each category. "
t3_drop_missing_y_var,"If the selected grouping variable has missing values in your dataset, you can only make an estimate by removing rows of data with missing values."
t3_null_difference,"If you use a t-test, the test evaluates whether the difference between the survey data's estimate and the benchmark value is equal to this value. To test whether there is any difference between the respondent data's estimate and the benchmark value, use the default value of zero."
t3_alternative,"If you use a t-test, you must also specify the alternative hypothesis. The default hypothesis is that the difference is unequal to the hypothesized difference, but you can also test whether the difference is less than or greater than the hypothesized difference."
t3_degrees_of_freedom,"(Optional) If you use a t-test, you can manually specify the degrees of freedom for the test. If you specify nothing, the application will use a reasonable default option based on your description of the data collection method."
t4_y_var,"Select one or more variables in the data which divide the sample into different subpopulations (e.g., race/ethnicity), and whose values you know for both respondents and nonrespondents. The application will test for differences between respondents and the target population."
t4_t_full_or_elig,"You can compare estimates based on respondents to the number of respondents estimated based on the full sample (regardless of eligibility status) or to the portion of the sample that you know to be eligible for the survey (i.e., just eligible respondents and eligible nonrespondents). If you know all of the sample to be eligible for the survey, then these options are equivalent."
t4_null_difference,"The t-test will evaluate whether the difference between respondents and the target population is equal to this value. To test whether there is any difference between the two groups, use the default value of zero."
t4_alternative,"The t-test requires you to specify an alternative hypothesis. The default hypothesis is that the difference between the two groups is unequal to the hypothesized difference, but you can also test whether the difference is less than or greater than the hypothesized difference."
t4_degrees_of_freedom,"(Optional) You can manually specify the degrees of freedom for the t-test. If you don't specify anything, the application will use a reasonable default option based on your description of the data collection method."
t5_replicate_weight_method,"The bootstrap and jackknife methods are both reasonable options. The bootstrap method is the default for this application because, while it is less statistically efficient than the jackknife, it generally takes much less time to run if there are more than 500 sampling units in the data."
t5_n_replicates,"If you select the bootstrap method of creating replicate weights, then you must choose the number of bootstrap replicates. The default value of 500 gives statistically reasonable estimates without being too demanding on the computer. You can choose to increase this number, for example to 1,000 or 2,000. The calculation will simply be more demanding on the computer and take longer to run. "

t5_raking_benchmark_vars,"For each grouping variable, the dataset should also have a corresponding variable giving the population benchmark (i.e., population size) for each category. "
t5_wt_adj_comparison_vars,"Select one or more outcome variable measured in the survey. For a numeric variable, the application will compare the estimated mean before and after the weighting adjustment. For a categorical variable, the application will compare the estimated proportions before and after the weighting adjustment."
t5_null_difference,"The test evaluates whether the difference between the weight-adjusted estimate and the unadjusted estimate is equal to this value. To test whether there is any difference between the adjusted and unadjusted estimate, use a value of zero."
t5_alternative,"This analysis uses a t-test, which requires you to specify an alternative hypothesis. The usual hypothesis is that the difference between the adjusted and unadjusted estimate is unequal to the hypothesized difference, but you can also test whether the difference is less than or greater than the hypothesized difference."
t5_degrees_of_freedom,"(Optional) You can manually specify the degrees of freedom for the t-test. If you do not specify anything, the application will use a reasonable default option based on your description of the data collection method."

t7_categorical_predictors,Select one or more categorical grouping variables in your datset to use as predictors in the regression model.
t7_outcome_variable,Choose an outcome variable measured in the survey. 
t7_outcome_type,"Select whether the outcome variable is a numeric (e.g., salary) or a binary categorical variable (e.g., agreement/disagreement on a questionnaire item). If the outcome variable is a binary categorical variable, the application will fit a logistic regression model."
t7_outcome_to_predict,"If the outcome variable is a binary categorical variable, choose which category of that variable the model should predict."

t7_max_iterations,"If you use the stepwise model selection, then the application will add and remove variables to the model in an iterative process based on p-values. Enter the maximum number of iterations of the procedure."
t8_y_var,Choose an outcome variable measured in the survey whose mean or proportion the application will estimate.
t8_y_var_type,"Choose whether the outcome variable is numeric or categorical. For numeric variables, the application estimates means. For categorical variables, the application estimates proportions for each category. "
t8_predictor_variable,"Select a numeric or ordinal variable in your dataset for which the application will calculate cumulative estimates. The variable should either be numeric or have categories with labels which, when sorted alphabetically, yield the order you desire."
